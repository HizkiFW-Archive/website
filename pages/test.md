# Hello!

Welcome to the test page. This page should demonstrate my web server's ability to transform markdown into both HTML and plaintext. It should render all the tags, links, text wrapping, etc. The following is just a jumble of all markdown elements.

First off, some basic formatting.

This text is **bold**, and this one is in _italics_. This next one is **_both bold and italic_**.

This is a [link](https://github.com/HizkiFW).

## Heading 2

This is a paragraph

### Heading 3

Here's another paragraph with a bullet list:

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
- Item three

#### Heading 4

And here's a numbered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three!

Some code in a block:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

And here's some inline `code` block.

Finally, to top things off, I'll put in an image below:
